What is BPSonMPI?
-----------------
BSPonMPI is a platform independent software library for developing parallel
programs. It implements the BSPlib standard for the most part and runs on all
machines which have MPI. This last property is the main feature of this
library and with this feature it distinguishes itself from other libraries
such as the Oxford BSP Toolset and PUB.

NOTE: 
1) The BSPlib standard is implemented with ONE exception: A call to bsp_init()
is mandatory.
2) You can find the BSPlib standard at http://www.bsp-worldwide.org .


Why should I use BSPonMPI?
--------------------------
Nowadays there are two major BSPlib implementations: Oxford BSP Toolset and
PUB.  Both are implemented for specific hardware platforms (Cray T3E or
SGI Origin, etc...) and they have a platform independent version on top of
MPI.  However the architecture of their software library is optimised for the
use of hardware specific features. Building on top of MPI was never their
primary objective. So if your hardware/software is not supported by one of
these two libraries, then you should use BSPonMPI in combination with an MPI
library. 


Availability
------------
Download the latest release from http://bsponmpi.sourceforge.net 


Prerequisites
-------------
To compile this library you need a
+ Compiler, linker, archiver, etc... (e.g. GNU Development tools)
+ an MPI library (e.g. MPICH, LAM/MPI)


Usage
------
Read the INSTALL file for installation instructions. 

* Compiling
BSPonMPI transforms a BSP program into an MPI program. Therefore you should
use your standard MPI compiler and/or add an MPI library to your linker
options. For example: when you have an MPI compiler 'mpicc' and you want to
compile your program example.c, you should do
$ mpicc -o example example.c -lbsponmpi
If you have to link your MPI programs to e.g. to the library 'mpi', do
$ cc -o example example.c -lmpi -lbsponmpi
Sometimes it matters in which order you pass your libraries to the linker. So
if it doesn't work, try reordering the linker/compiler arguments.

* Running
After compilation you program is an MPI program. Run it using the command you
always use to run MPI programs (or consult your system administrator)
e.g.
$ mpirun -np 4 example
Runs the 'example' program on 4 processors when you use the MPICH library.

Documentation
-------------
Several documents are available on http://bsponmpi.sourceforge.net
* Architecture description, Code documentation
* A report on implementing the library:
  - Pros and Cons of the library
  - Methods used to speed up the library
  - Comparison to the Oxford BSP Toolset using a benchmark

Note on testing: Testing is performed by doing a 'make check'. The test suite
doesn't catch all errors. Therefore it is possible that there are still a few
bugs in this library

Support & Feedback
------------------
This library has been tested, but not extensively. It may still contain bugs. 
If you have written a BSP program which doesn't work and you blame this
library, please contact me. On the other hand if you have written a BSP
program which works perfectly with BSPonMPI, let me know! I am curious.
