This is a list of features which will be implemented in succeeding releases.
Feel free to send additions to me.
  
Performance:
* Implement the memoryRegister_find such that it is O(1) in stead of O(n)
  (e.g. hash on least significant bits) 

Usability:
* Make it ready for use on program development and education: Make a
  compiler option or special shared library to detect programming errors in a
  BSP program (in run time), e.g.:
  - writing outside a registered memory area
  - out of sync bsp_sync()'s
  - registering more than one NULL pointer
  - ...
  - internal consistency checks. 
  - etc...
