INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
*************************

(March 2012, Peter Krusche)

This version of BSPonMPI uses SCons (www.scons.org) to compile and 
build. After downloading and installing SCons, you can compile the 
library by running 

 $ scons -Q mode=release
 
in the BSPonMPI checkout directory.

The libraries will be placed in the "lib" subdirectory of the checkout
directory. You can either add this directory to the library path when
compiling your code, or install the libraries publicly on Unix using 
e.g.

 # cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
 # cp -R include/* /usr/local/include

Most users don't have root privileges on compute clusters, so the 
automatic install option has been removed. Furthermore, this version
of BSPonMPI only supports static linking (there is not that much code,
and messing with LD_LIBRARY_PATH through job submission systems can be 
a bit of a pain...).

On Windows, you can add the "lib" and "include" paths to the linker and
compiler input paths in your MSVC project.

The following options can be specified (either via command line, or 
using the file "opts.py", which is read automatically each time SCons
is run.

                    Default is:

additional_lflags   Additional linker flags
                    Use this to add linker flags if the code does not
                    link on your system.
additional_cflags   Additional compiler flags
                    Use this to add compiler flags if the code does not
                    compile on your system.

MPICXX              MPI c++ compiler wrapper (Unix only)          mpicxx
MPILINK             MPI linker wrapper (Unix only)                mpicxx

scons -h shows any other options available through the script.

Any more intricate issues can probably be fixed by editing SConstruct.
The original BSPonMPI tests will be compiled and placed in the "bin" 
directory.

Happy BSPing.
