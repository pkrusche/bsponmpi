Please read the README file from BSPedupack.

The only difference in running the programs from BSPedupack
and those from MPIedupack are:

1. The running command
       $ bsprun -npes 3 ip
   becomes  
       $ mpirun -np   3 ip
   (on my system, but running MPI can be different at your site).

2. The question 
       How many processors do you want to use?
   is not asked in MPIedupack, since you cannot easily use less 
   than the maximum number of processors.

3. You may need to create an input file in the MPI case,
   instead of answering the input questions interactively.
