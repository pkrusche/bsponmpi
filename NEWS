BSPonMPI 0.3
============
The main new features are: 
- Windows port. The library can now be compiled on Windows using any MPI 
  implementation that is available on this platform (MPICH, Microsoft MPI, etc.)
  The distribution includes solution and project files for MSVC.
- Global DRMA support. This works just like normal DRMA, but allocates
  memory which is distributed across all nodes:
	
	bsp_global_handle_t bsp_global_alloc(size_t array_size);
	void bsp_global_free(bsp_global_handle_t ptr);

  After allocating, you will need to call bsp_sync() to register 
  the shared memory segments. 

  (Hp)put and -get functions work in a similar fashion to normal bsp_put/bsp_get, 
  but only get an offset into the global buffer (instead of specifying node
  and offset). The node that holds the corresponding data is determined 
  automatically according to the data distribution (block cyclic atm).
  
    void bsp_global_get(bsp_global_handle_t src, 
		size_t offset, void * dest, size_t size);
    void bsp_global_put(const void * src, 
		bsp_global_handle_t dest, size_t offset, size_t size);
    void bsp_global_hpget(bsp_global_handle_t src, 
		size_t offset, void * dest, size_t size);
    void bsp_global_hpput(const void * src, 
		bsp_global_handle_t dest, size_t offset, size_t size);

  All global memory functions are declared in bsp_global_drma.h.

BSPonMPI 0.2
============
The main feature of this release is: More Speed. The main data structures were
redesigned and rewritten which has resulted in more efficient code. 



BSPonMPI 0.1
============
I am proud to present the first release of BSPonMPI. This software library
implements the BSPlib standard on top of MPI. Main features are:
- Platform independence: it is designed to be platform independent and it is
  already tested and found to run on several different architectures including
  the dutch national supercomputer and my laptop.
- Speed: Benchmark results show that on DRMA 'puts' it is slightly slower than
  the Oxford BSP Toolset, but it is much faster performing DRMA 'gets' or BSMP
  'sends'.
- Easy usage: To use this library just link your source code with the MPI and
  BSPonMPI libraries and you get an MPI program. You do not need to recompile this
  library ever. All your programs will run with equal efficiency.
